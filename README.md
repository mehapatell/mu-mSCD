# mu-mSCD
mu-mSCD is a proposed algorithm for solving large scale linear systems with missing/ corrupt data by modifying Stochastic Coordinate Descent (SCD) such that that the new algorithm converges to an optimal solution given a linear system with i.i.d. Bernoulli missing column entries of a data matrix that has mean mu
