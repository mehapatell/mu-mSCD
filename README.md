# mu-mSCD
The following MATLAB code introduces mu-mSCD, which is our proposed algorithm for solving large scale linear systems with missing/ corrupt data by modifying Stochastic Coordinate Descent (SCD) such that that the new algorithm converges to an optimal solution given a linear system with i.i.d. Bernoulli missing column entries of a data matrix that has mean mu
